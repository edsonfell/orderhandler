# Order Handler

Order Handler is an API responsible for distributing the orders to it respective area in the kitchen. It's simple project build with .Net Core 3.1 just to practice my skills and learn new ones.

To build and run the project you can use both Visual Studio or the .Net Core CLI library with your favorite Editor.

The application isn't using any external library, just pure .Net Core 3.1 and xUnit for the unit tests.

The project contain some comments to explain you about the structure and functions that I've created.

Feel free to give any tips or recomendations about my code or it structure.
